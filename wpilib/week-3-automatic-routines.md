# Week 3: Automatic Routines

### 3.1 PathPlanner

Pathplanner is a convenient tool we use to create autos, and it provides a library to interpret them and run them with code. Auto paths are made on the app, then automatically put into the `deploy/pathplanner` directory, where they can be run using PathPlanner lib.

### 3.2 Deploy Directory

The deploy directory is where you can put files along with your code, which will then be deployed to the robot along with the code. (This is why PathPlanner and YAGSL files need to be in there)
