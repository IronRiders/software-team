# Week 2: Driver Control

### 2.1 NetworkTables

NetworkTables lets you post information up in the code and other parts  
can access it. This enables us to display values to the driver, and  
make dynamic values accessible to every subsystem.

### 2.2 Command Triggers

WPILib provides handy classes for different controllers which we use  
that have 'hooks' which you can attach commands to to make them run  
when a button in pressed, released, held down, etc.

### 2.3 Good Control Systems

Responsive, intuitive controls are important for the driver's performance  
during competition. Making control systems feel good to use is generally  
pretty simple. Gus WILL have an aneurysm if we don't do this.
