# Software Team Quickstart Guide

Welcome!  If you're here you have at least passing interest in coding for the Iron Riders.  Here you'll find pointers on how to get started.

## What You Need To Know

There are a number of tools and technologies we use as a team that you should familiarize yourself with.  If you aren't an expert in some (or all!) of these, don't worry.  There's tons of learning resources online and your teammates and mentors are here to help!

Here are some places for you to begin exploration:

- [Tools & Setup](#tools) - learn about GitHub, VS Code and FRC Game Tools
- [Programming](#programming) - learn the Java programming language and FIRST-specific topics

## Tools

A good first step is to get your laptop set up for programming.  It's much easier to familiarize yourself with stuff you have available and running on your computer.

Unfortunately we can't currently do this install on school laptops.  So you'll need your own, but if you don't have one talk to the team and we'll figure out how to get one for you.

Here's some specific things you should install & familiarize yourself with:

- [GitHub](./tools/README.md/#github)
- [VS Code](./tools/README.md/#vs-code)
- [FRC Game Tools](./tools/README.md/#libraries-and-apps)

## Programming

With installation out of the way, you're ready for the fun part - actually coding!

Depending on your skill level, here are some resources to help you pick up the basics of what you'll need to be a productive robot software engineer.

Programming is a large topic but please don't get overwhelmed - FIRST is designed for beginners and you don't need to know everything about technologies like Java to be productive. And please don't be afraid to ask for help!
