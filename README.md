# Software Team Quickstart Guide

Welcome!  If you're here you have at least passing interest in coding for IronRiders.  Here you'll find pointers on how to get started.

TODO - this document is a work in progress, incomplete sections marked with TODO

## What you need to know

There are a number of tools and technologies we use as a team that you should familiarize yourself with.  If you aren't an expert in some (or all!) of these, don't worry.  There's tons of learning resources online and your teammates and mentors are here to help!

Here are some places for you to begin exploration:

- [Tools & Setup](#tools) - learn about GitHub, VS Code and FRC Game Tools
- [Programming](#programming) - learn the Java programming language and FIRST-specific topics

## Tools

A good first step is to get your laptop set up for programming.  It's much easier to familiarize yourself with stuff you have available and running on your computer.

Unfortunately we can't currently do this install on school laptops.  So you'll need your own, but if you don't have one talk to the team and we'll figure out how to get one for you.

Here's some specific things you should install & familiarize yourself with:

- [GitHub](#github)
- [VS Code](#vs-code)
- [FRC Game Tools](#frc-game-tools)

### GitHub

We use Git and GitHub for managing source code files and other information (like this file!)

_Git_ is an open source "source control" system.  It is a tool that runs on your local computer.  You probably already have git installed.

_GitHub_ is a website that offers a central place for teams to manage projects.

[Learn about Git and GitHub here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)

You are ready to use GitHub when:

- You've used Git to create a copy of IronRiders code on your local computer
- You are familiar with the following:
  - _cloning a repository_
  - _committing_, _pushing_ and _creating pull requests_
  - _pulling_ and _rebasing_
  - _reviewing pull requests_

IronRiders code is at https://github.com/IronRiders.  You'll need your own GitHub account and permission to access the IronRiders organization.

### VS Code

VS Code is software for writing software.  Normally you would download VS Code from Microsoft and install yourself.  But don't do that!  FRC provides its own version of VS Code.  Unless you know what you're using, just use that.

So, to get VS Code installed see [WPILib](wpilib) below.

FRC's [VS Code Overview](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/) is a good place to learn more about VS Code.

### WPILib

_WPILib_ refers to both the software libraries that FRC provides for writing robots and a massive (2GB+) installer that installs everything you need to program a robot.

To install WPILib, follow [FRC's instructions].  Be sure to say "yes" when it asks if you want to install [VS Code](#vs-code).

## Programming

With installation out of the way, you're ready for the fun part - actually coding!

Depending on your skill level, here are some resources to help you pick up the basics of what you'll need to be a productive robot software engineer.

Programming is a large topic but please don't get overwhelmed - FIRST is designed for beginners and you don't need to know everything about technologies like Java to be productive.  And don't be afraid to ask for help!

We could use a repository like this to store key information for the 4180 software team.  This file could become an introductory welcome page for new developers with helpful "getting started" links.
