### Practice Project

For the final part of your Java training, you will build a program that reads user input from the console and  
does something cool. This is a vague goal, so it's up to you to figure out what you want to make. It can be  
relatively small and simple but try to actually use everything you learned.

Example Ideas:

* Currency Converter (user gives amount and currency input, converter gives output in given currency)
* Number Guessing Game (program picks random number, user tries to guess it while program gives hints)
